# Inheritance-Polymorphic-Data-Structure
I designed this program as per project specifications. This was one of my earlier projects in Java where I was required to follow the central tenets of inheritance and polymorphism between different classes. The project guidelines had stated to have a parent class titled "Drink" and two child classes labeled "DrinkInBox" and "DrinkCylinder". The Drink parent class was required to be an abstract class, so no instance of that class was to be declared but rather only one of its child classes can be instantiated. Drink parent object holds some common overlapping information such as name, productID, and unit price. Then the two subclasses hold more specific questions like product dimensions and angles. The user enters data into the program following a standard format. The program must then parse the given information, determine which object to initiate and build the correct data structure with the correct values. Then the newly initiated data structure must be stored in memory so the user can access formerly created objects.
